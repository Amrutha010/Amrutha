      The purpose of this arrow demo is to indicate that there is further content down the page. While studies have generally shown that users <em>do, in fact,</em> scroll (thus killing the worries about page fold), it still has become somewhat fashionable to indicate scroll intent.

    <p>
      A subtle animation triggered after a period of time draws attention to the scroll indicator. Some jQuery hides the indicator after the user begins scrolling.
